Text Analysis and the Discursive Foundations of Nineteenth Century Populism

Project Description: Historians have begun to turn to natural language processing as a way of studying various social phenomena.  This Digital Humanities project examines populism in the 19th century US. The primary objectives of this capstone are to (a) construct a corpus of text from the National Economist—the official newspaper of the Farmer’s Alliance, which served as the organizational backbone of the Populist movement during this period and (b) conduct analysis based on techniques including, but not limited to, structural topic modeling and word embedding. The files in question are stored in pdf format and would need to be converted to machine-readable text, which can then be processed using existing software.
